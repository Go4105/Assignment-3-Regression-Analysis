# Assignment-3-Regression-Analysis
Diamond Beckom

For this assignment, I walked through a full regression analysis using a real dataset on income by occupation and gender. My goal was to see whether the proportion of women in an occupation had any relationship to the overall weekly income for that occupation. I went through the full process: importing the data, cleaning and preparing it, exploring the patterns (EDA), building a regression model, evaluating that model, and finally making predictions based on different gender compositions within occupations. Throughout the process, I tried to keep everything as simple and direct as possible, especially since the dataset needed a bit of cleaning before I could run any real analysis.

To start, I imported the Excel file into R using readxl, then converted several columns—specifically the income fields—from text into numeric values. The dataset originally stored incomes like "1,234" as character strings rather than numbers, so I used gsub() to remove commas and then converted the results to numeric values. I also calculated a new variable, prop_female, which represented the proportion of women in each occupation. After that, I cleaned the dataset further by removing any rows with missing weekly income values or occupations with zero workers. Once I had a clean dataset, I checked the summaries of my key variables just to get a sense of the ranges and make sure everything looked reasonable.

Next, I moved into the exploratory data analysis (EDA). I created histograms for overall weekly income and for the proportion of women across occupations. The weekly income distribution was fairly spread out, which makes sense because salaries vary a lot by occupation. The distribution of prop_female showed that some occupations were heavily male-dominated, while others had more balance or even a female majority. I also created a scatterplot comparing prop_female to overall weekly income, with a linear regression line added. This plot helped me visually see whether there was any trend between the percentage of women in a field and how much those occupations paid.

After exploring the data, I built my main regression model based on the question: Does the proportion of female workers predict weekly income?

Once I ran summary(model1), I looked at the coefficient for prop_female to understand the direction of the relationship. A negative coefficient would mean that occupations with more women tend to have lower weekly income on average, while a positive coefficient would suggest the opposite. I also paid attention to the p-value to see whether the relationship was statistically significant, and the R-squared value to check how well the model explained the variation in income. As expected with real-world data, the model didn’t explain all the variation—income is influenced by a lot of factors beyond gender composition—but it still helped highlight the general trend.

To check whether the model met its assumptions, I looked at the diagnostic plots. These included the residuals versus fitted plot, QQ plot, scale-location plot, and leverage plot. I mainly focused on checking whether the residuals were evenly spread (which supports linearity and homoscedasticity) and whether they roughly followed a straight line in the QQ plot (which supports normality). While no real dataset is perfectly clean, the model behaved reasonably well for the purposes of this assignment.

At the end, I generated predictions using new hypothetical data. I created three example occupations with proportion female values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. Using predict(), I calculated the expected weekly income for each case, along with 95% prediction intervals. These intervals provide a range where the actual weekly income would likely fall for an occupation with that gender composition. This step helped me take the regression model beyond just describing the data; it gave me a way to estimate real outcomes for new situations, which is one of the most useful parts of regression.

Overall, this regression analysis helped me understand how gender composition may relate to income across different occupations. By going through data cleaning, EDA, building the model, evaluating its assumptions, and making predictions, I got hands-on experience with the full modeling process in R. Even though the dataset wasn’t perfect, and the model didn’t capture everything about why incomes differ, it still gave me a clear and structured way to explore the relationship between gender and earnings. The process also helped reinforce why cleaning data and checking assumptions matter just as much as running the model itself.
